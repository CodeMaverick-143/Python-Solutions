In the country of Timeland, the people follow a unique system of classifying days based on two variables: the temperature and humidity. Determine the kind of day, based on the following criteria:

1) If the temperature is above 35 degrees:
  a) If the humidity is above 70%, classify the day as Tropical.
  b) Else, classify the day as Desert.

2) If the temperature is between 20 and 35  degrees (inclusive):
  a) If the humidity is above 70%, classify the day as Rainy.
  b) If the humidity is between 40% and 70% (inclusive), classify the day as Average.
  c) Else, classify the day as Dry.

3) If the temperature is below 20degrees:
   a) If the humidity is above 70%, classify the day as Cold.
   b) Else, classify the day as Winter
Input
The input consists of two space- separated integers: temperatureand humidity (in percentage).

Constraints:
-10 ≤ temperature ≤ 50
10 ≤ humidity ≤ 100
Output
Determine the type of day ( "Tropical", "Desert", "Rainy", "Average", "Dry", "Cold", and "Winter") based on the temperature and humidity.
Example
Input:
25 75

Output:
Rainy

Explanation:
Given the temperature as 25 and humidity as 75%:

Since the temperature is between 20 and 35 degrees (inclusive), we move into the second major condition.
Within this temperature bracket, we check the humidity:
The humidity is above 70%.
Therefore, according to our conditions, the day is classified as a "Rainy".
Hence, the output is "Rainy".
