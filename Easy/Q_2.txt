Given two integers a and b, your task is to calculate and print the following four values:-
a+b
a-b
a*b
a/b
Input
The input contains two integers a and b separated by spaces.

Constraints:
1 ≤ b ≤ a ≤ 1000
It is guaranteed that a will be divisible by b
Output
Print the mentioned operations each in a new line.
Example
Sample Input:
15 3

Sample Output:
18
12
45
5

Explanation:-
First operation is a+b so 15+3 = 18
The second Operation is a-b so 15-3 = 12
Third Operation is a*b so 15*3 = 45
Fourth Operation is a/b so 15/3 = 5
