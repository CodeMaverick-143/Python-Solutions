Given length l, width b and height h of a cuboid. The task is to find the total surface area and volume of cuboid.
Input
User Task:
Since this will be a functional problem, you don't have to take input. You just have to complete the functions:-
Surface_Area() that takes the integer l, b and h as parameter.
Volume() that takes the integer l, b and h as parameter.

Constraints:
1 <= l, b, h <= 10^2
Output
Return the surface area of cuboid in function Surface_Area() and return Volume of cuboid in function Volume().
Example
Sample Input:
1 2 3

Sample Output:
22 6

Explanation:
Test Case 1: The total surface area for the given cuboid is 22 and its volume 6.
