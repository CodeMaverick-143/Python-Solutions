Chef is very hungry. So, Chef goes to a shop selling burgers. The shop has 2 types of burgers:
Normal burgers, which cost X rupees each
Premium burgers, which cost Y rupees each (where Y > X)
Chef has R rupees. Chef wants to buy exactly N burgers. He also wants to maximize the number of premium burgers he buys. Determine the number of burgers of both types Chef must buy.
Output -1 if it is not possible for Chef to buy N burgers.
Input
The first line contains a single integer T — the number of test cases. Then the test cases follow.
The first and only line of each test case contains four space- separated integers X, Y, N and R — the cost of a normal burger, the cost of a premium burger, the number of burgers Chef wants to buy and the amount of money Chef has.

Constraints
1 ≤ T ≤ 104
1≤ X < Y ≤ 1000
1≤ N ≤ 106
1≤ R ≤ 109
Output
For each test case, output on a new line two integers: the number of normal burgers and the number of premium burgers Chef must buy satisfying the given conditions.
Output -1 if he cannot buy N burgers.
